Johnathan got started doing web development in the non-profit world shortly after graduating from UNC. He then learned about Laravel and its great ecosystem and adopted it rather quickly. He's been specializing in that for over four years, which includes Vue as well.

Johnathan lives in Holly Springs, NC with his beautiful, amazing wife Sarah, their adorable daughter Kristabelle, and their newborn boy, Levi. Quirky fact: one time while trekking through Iceland, he ate puffin and whale. ðŸ¤¨

He enjoys family time, gardening, trying new coffee blends, and engineering awesome web applications.

Some other technologies that currently pique his interest are:

- Go
- Python
- Asynchronous and parallel processing
- IoT
